Process
-------
Describe how you approached designing your solution to the problem?
Firstly, I setup a repo on github ( https://github.com/MariusGG/Bank-test )
Following the TDD process of writing a failing test and then passing it, I make sure to have regular commits to git. Using 'git status' to see any files that need to be committed, allows me to keep track of my work flow.
I've found regular commits and writing testing then passing them, makes a for a better understanding of my code.
Also following this process allows me to write clear code which is easy to change.

Setup:
-------

Make sure you have ruby installed to interact with the code via a REPL like IRB.
